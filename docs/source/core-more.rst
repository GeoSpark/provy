provy.core and provy.more
=========================

*provy* is divided in two namespaces: *provy.core* and *provy.more*. It is divided like this to make it easier to find the roles you need.

*provy.core* features the code that actually makes *provy* run, like the console app or the base Role.

*provy.more* features every single specialized role that helps users in provisioning servers, like *NginxRole* or *AptitudeRole*.

Both will be documented here, even though you are advised to take a look at the code, since the docs might not be up-to-date yet.
